# DocBot
PPL Mini-Project :

1. Title of project : DocBot  

2. Name: Madhavi Ninganur

3. Reason for selecting Problem :  
With the sudden onset of the coronavirus pandemic, our lives have been affected in unfamiliar ways. One of the biggest fears that this situation has induced is, perhaps, waking up feeling ill. What further aggravates the situation is the probability that you could have simply caught a cold. Unfortunately, what ends up tormenting people is that feeling of uncertainty. Since they are too scared to visit the doctor, they pretend that nothing is wrong with them. But somewhere at the back of their minds lie those nagging feelings of self-doubt and guilt. Ultimately, people are forced to suffer in silence with no answers to any of their questions.  

4. Current state of art to solve the problem :  
Currently if a person finds themselves ill, they will most probably pretend to be completely healthy.
Now, there do exist platforms to enable medical consultations with doctors virtually. However, they seldom (if ever) help people find answers, since most doctors end up either second-guessing themselves or refusing to make any assumptions without a proper checkup.  

5. Our solution to problem :  
In order to solve this issue, we decided to try creating a medical chatbot which would let users describe the symptoms they were showing and try to deduce the disease they might have contracted. In this way, users can remain anonymous while still getting a rough idea of the illness they might possibly have.  

6. Technology used :  
Back-end - TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, NumPy  
Front-end - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS  
Integration - Flask, Selenium  

7. Future developments :  
Increasing the accuracy of the model to predict an illness that is most appropriate for the symptoms mentioned, and to make the chatbot more human-like so that the interaction is made even better.
